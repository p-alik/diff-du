`diff-du` is a little tool for tracking down where your disk space is going
by comparing two `du` runs.  Features:

- Takes an optional size threshold, below which diffs are not output.
- Once a diff is output, it is not counted for its parents.  (See example.)
- Children of new or removed directories are ignored.
- Output is sorted by diff size.
- Output is in unified diff format.  Programs that do syntax highlighting
  should detect it automatically; try piping to `vi -`.
- Accepts gzipped `du` output files.
- Runs `du` for you if given a directory.

Here is an example (these files exist in the distribution):

`test/example.1.du`:

    5       /home/andrew/mail
    10      /home/andrew/my-proj/src
    10      /home/andrew/my-proj
    10      /home/andrew/old-proj
    25      /home/andrew

`test/example.2.du`:

    10      /home/andrew/mail
    20      /home/andrew/my-proj/src
    25      /home/andrew/my-proj
    10      /home/andrew/new-proj/src
    20      /home/andrew/new-proj
    60      /home/andrew

`diff-du --threshold 10 test/example.1.du test/example.2.du`:

    --- test/example.1.du
    +++ test/example.2.du
    +20      /home/andrew/new-proj
    +15      /home/andrew
    +10      /home/andrew/my-proj/src
    -10      /home/andrew/old-proj

Notes:

- Output is ordered, with the largest diff first, and negative diffs at the
  end.
- The `+5` diff for `/home/andrew/mail` is not output because it is below
  the threshold.
- Children of `/home/andrew/new-proj` are not output.
- `/home/andrew/my-proj` is not output, because a diff of `+10` has already
  been counted for `/home/andrew/my-proj/src`, and the remaining `+5` is
  below the threshold.
- The `+15` diff for `/home/andrew` represents the part of the actual `+35`
  diff that is not output for its children.

The last two points are potentially confusing, but in my opinion this the
most useful for focusing on the real changes.

Usage
=====

    Usage: diff-du [--threshold N] PATH PATH
    PATH is either
    - a directory to run du on OR
    - a file (possibly gzipped) containing du output
      -h    --help          print this message
      -t N  --threshold=N   ignore differences below this threshold
            --du-prog=PROG  use PROG as du
            --du-arg=ARG    pass ARG on to du

Building
========

Run `make`.  Requires the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler][ghc].  The executable
will be called `diff-du`.  There is no install target, so just copy it to
its final location yourself.

Hacking
=======

`diff-du` is written in pretty straight-forward Haskell.  If you don't know
much Haskell, please ask and I will try to help.  It would also be easy to
port to another language.

TODO
====

I would love suggestions for making `diff-du` more useful and intuitive.

Related Work
============

I was surprised that not much effort has gone into addressing this problem.
There is a [Stack Overflow thread][stack] from 2009 asking about it, with
only one little script offered as an answer (until I posted this).  Llu√≠s
Batlle i Rossell has written a simple version called [`du-diff`][du-diff].
That's all I found.
